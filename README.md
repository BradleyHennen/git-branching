git branching practice

This is a project to practice branching with git.

Some branching commands:
- 'git branch' shows you the branchse and which one you are on
- 'git branch branch_name' creates a branch called branch_name
- 'git checkout branch_name' checks out the branch called branch_name
- 'git push remote_name branch_name' pushes code from branch_name to the remote_name (usually 'origin')

I am causing trouble....
